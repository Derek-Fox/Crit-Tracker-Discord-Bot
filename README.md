# Crit-Tracker-Discord-Bot

Project to experiment with Discord API and Google Sheets API. Should read from a text channel in Discord and parse Nat 20's and Nat 1's submitted to that channel, then save them to a Google Sheet. Lots of things are hardcoded - this is not intended to be used by anyone but me as is, but you can certainly edit it to suit your needs!

Some code taken from Google Sheets API Tutorials - python quickstart and read/write cell pages.
